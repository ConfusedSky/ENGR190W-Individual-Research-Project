# ABSTRACT
Blockchain is a versatile and scalable technology that most people associate exclusivly with Bitcoin. Blockchain has many more uses than just Bitcoin and is will become necessary in the near future. Current technology can't leverage all of the processing and resources that we have available. Blockchain allows us to leverage most or all of the processing power and storage on a network securely in a very scalable way. Current implementations are not perfect and there are a lot of social and environmental issues. However with a little more research and adoption Blockchain will make as big of a difference as the Internet did when it was first introduced. 

# INTRODUCTION
Whenever people hear the word Blockchain genereally the first thing people thing about is Bitcoin or other crytocurrencies.
There is however so much more to Blockchain technology than cryptocurrencies.
In a world of increased demand for data processing and security, we need systems with increased reliability and scalability. 
The current model for the internet does not scale that well and is quickly approaching a point at which we will not be able to keep up with the ever increasing demands of the public. 
Enter Blockchain a new technology will allow us to leverage more of the resources that we have at our disposal that are wasted by the current model of the internet. 
I'll start this paper by discussing what Blockchain is, who created it, and a breif summary of how it works.
Iâ€™ll then talk about the creator of the first blockchain. Then we will talk about 3 different blockchain technology and how these technologies can be leveraged to build truly distributed systems. Then we will talk about ethical and environmental concerns involved.
