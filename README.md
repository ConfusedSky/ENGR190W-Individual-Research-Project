# ABSTRACT
Blockchain is a versatile and scalable technology that most people associate exclusivly with Bitcoin. Blockchain has many more uses than just Bitcoin and is will become necessary in the near future. Current technology can't leverage all of the processing and resources that we have available. Blockchain allows us to leverage most or all of the processing power and storage on a network securely in a very scalable way. Current implementations are not perfect and there are a lot of social and environmental issues. However with a little more research and adoption Blockchain will make as big of a difference as the Internet did when it was first introduced.

# INTRODUCTION
Whenever people hear the word Blockchain genereally the first thing people thing about is Bitcoin or other crytocurrencies.
There is however so much more to Blockchain technology than cryptocurrencies.
In a world of increased demand for data processing and security, we need systems with increased reliability and scalability. 
The current model for the internet does not scale that well and is quickly approaching a point at which we will not be able to keep up with the ever increasing demands of the public. 
Enter Blockchain, a new technology will allow us to leverage more of the resources that we have at our disposal that are wasted by the current model of the internet. 

I'll start this paper by discussing what Blockchain is, who created it, and a breif summary of how it works.
I'll folow this with a simple explaination of how Blockchain works. 
Iâ€™ll then talk about the creator of the first Blockchain: The mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.

Then we get to the fun stuff. 
If there were no concrete implementations of this technology this wouldn't be an interesting topic. 
There are three main Blockchain implementations that I want to talk about. 
First, everyone's favorite form of legal gambling: Bitcoin. 
Second, as we start producing exponentially increasing amount of data we need a better way of storing and transmitting data. 
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is the solution to the oversaturated and transient nature of the internet.

But nothing is entirely good, all advancements have drawbacks. Blockchain is no exception. The "Bitcoin goldrush" has had negative effects on the economics of computer parts.
Computers have, especially graphics processors have skyrocketed in price due to the demand as blockchains require a significant amount of processing to function. The significant amount of processing power also has another drawback in the form of power usage. 
Without further ado lets get into it!

# BLOCKCHAIN

## What is Blockchain?
So you likely have heard of Blockchain before, but more than likely you only associate it with Bitcoin. 
So what exactly is Blockchain?
One definition is:

> A continuously growing list of records, called *blocks*, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block generally contains a cryptogrphic hash of the previous block [@BlockchainIntroduction].

Another definition is: 

> "An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
